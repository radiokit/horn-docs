Welcome to RadioKit Horn's documentation!
===========================================

RadioKit Horn is your playout in the cloud, which can help you run additional
streams without additional studios. It's perfect for having a backup in case
of emergency or for re-use of content produced on your main channel.
It can be as well used, as an outside broadcasting studio.
